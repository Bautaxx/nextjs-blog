In a world were we thought that events had a time variable defining whether it had ocurred in the past or if it was happening simultaneously to someone analyzing that event. The concept of General Relativity struck us hardly because it massively changed our reality. 

Going from thinking about a universal time which was the same for every living person no matter where it lived to having to take into consideration the aspect of space, from which together with time composed **********************spacetime.********************** 

**How does spacetime affect our preconceptions of time?**

Spacetime is defined by Einstein including inside of it the concept of the gravitational field, which was something lacking in Newton’s definition of gravity. These gravitational fields curve themselves where there is mass accumulated and now time “passes” slower there, than it would in places where the gravitational field is not curved. 

One example of spacetime curving up a lor appears on black holes. Black holes are the so-called ‘dead stars’ (previous stars which have run out of hydrogen fuel, meaning that instead of particles colliding with each other, they end up contracting due to gravitational effects) where spacetime is highly curved and time ‘passes’ slower than it does on earth. This is why we see the moment when the stars dies (becoming a black hole) millions of years after it really happened.

**Is it okay to think about time?**

Time is a concept invented to unify relations between variables. Galileo first discovered that a pendulum took the same amount to oscilate regardless of its amplitude by measuring it with his heart beat pulse. Meaning that he was comparing two variables, *********************************how much beats there are in a pendulum oscilation and viceversa.********************************* 

This is why time is only a tool to make it easier to compare variables but it is not an intrinsic aspect of the universe. It is purely an invention by someone approaching to make measurements easier.
